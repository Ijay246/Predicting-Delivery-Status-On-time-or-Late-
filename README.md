# Delivery Prediction Model  

A **Streamlit web application** that predicts whether a delivery will be **On-time** or **Late** based on user inputs such as agent rating, traffic, area, weather, and more.  

The app uses a **Logistic Regression model** trained and saved as `log_model.pkl`.

## ✨ Features  

-  **Agent Rating** – Rating of the delivery agent (1–6).  
-  **Pick-Up Hour** – Time of the day when the parcel is picked up (0–13).  
-  **Traffic** – Categorical traffic condition (High, Jam, Low, Medium).  
-  **Area** – Categorical area type (Metropolitan, Semi-Urban, Urban, Other).  
- ☁ **Weather** – Categorical weather condition (Cloudy, Fog, Sandstorms, Stormy, Sunny, Windy).  
-  **Agent Age** – Age of the delivery agent (15–50).  

The model then predicts:  
-  **On-time**  
-  **Late**
